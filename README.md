Yet another c++ library for vector algebra, optimization, regression and more.

I created this library years ago and I have not worked on it for a
some years. However I have found it useful and realtively easy to work
with. I need to do some cosmetical changes to the source before
uploading all of it. If I can keep my motivation up and/or there is
any interest the following parts will be added in the coming months:

* Core - available

Inlucdes the matrix/vector class. The function class. Basic
functions. All functions support function composition and analytical derivatives. 

* Solvers - available

A n-dimensional Newtonâ€“Raphson solver.

* Optimization - not ready

Includes an unconstrained n-dimensional maximizer, a n-dimsnsional
maximizer for problems with equality constraints, and a n-dimensional
maximizer for problems with inequality constraints. 

* Plot - available - beta

General plot utility that plots using gnuplot.

* Fit - OLS available, more to come

The code id made public as is and to build the libraries run make &&
make install in the src directory. The built libraries are placed in the
libs dir.

* and more ...

General fit utilities. So far I have only added the OLS estimator but
I have already written a general Cureve Fiting function and Logit and
Probit estimators. 


Docs
----

See the src/tests dir for how to use the classes. The general
convention for typdefs are:

_ prefix denotes a templated class:

typedef matrix<double> _m;

$ prefix denotes a shared_ptr class:

typdef shared_ptr<_m> $_m;

$$ prefix denotes a unique_ptr class:

typdef unique_ptr<_m> $$_m;


Tests
-----

All tests are placed in the src/test folder. Read the source code to
see examples of how to use the classes.

Dependencies
------------

The following dependencies are mandatory:

* f2c

* slatec (downloaded and compiled in the make process)

* and more
